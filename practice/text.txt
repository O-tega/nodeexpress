Timely and accurate information (data) is essential for performing our various day-to-day tasks, including decision making. This information is provided to us from various sources. Some of this information is explicitly “pushed” to us via such mechanisms as television and radio advertisements, telemarketing, electronic billboards, and flyers in the mail. Other information we explicitly seek and “pull” onto our laptops to read. Information that is sent to us, without our explicitly asking, is usually of a general nature. Information we explicitly seek is usually of a personal nature. Obviously, we need to expend more effort in obtaining
information that is of particular interest only to us. In the world of computing, there is a similar model of information delivery. Information in which we are interested can be obtained through two modes: on-demand and publish-subscribe.
